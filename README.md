# About RayTracer
This is a simple ray tracer built using the openframeworks framework. The application opens with a single
sphere. The user can add another sphere by toggling the "Add Sphere 2" button. Rays are shot from each 
pixel on the screen straight in the z direction. If sphere 1 is hit, the pixel that the ray originated
from will be yellow. If sphere 2 is hit, the pixel will be blue. If both are hit, the pixel will be green.
